         <h2>Introducing My Site </h2>

         <p>My name is Patricio Spamer, but my friends call me Pato, which means duck in spanish.  I received a Bachelor of Business     
            Administration in Finance from the Cox School of Business, and a Bachelor of Science in Economics with Financial Applications 
            from Dedman college, both schools in Southern Methodist University.  I am now seeking to gain a background in technology
            so that I will better my ability to add value to my fathers logistics and industrial real estate firm.  I am
            hoping that by gaining this background in tech, that I will be able to bring technological innovation to a very traditional 
            but successful bricks and mortar company that is CIL logistics. </p>
            <p>
            I believe that the best way to add value to my fathers firm
            will be to recruit and manage a high quality software team that will help me create and implement innovative technologies
            that will take us from being a small company of roughly 100 employees to a fast growing company of 500+ employees.  In addition
            to work that we will be doing for the family business, I want this software team to help me implement some of my own startup ideas 
            that are not related to logistics or real estate.  I believe my greatest asset is my sense of vision and perspective, and I hope
            to combine these skills with technical expertise to become a high capacity businessman. </p>

            <p> I am also an angel investor in technology startups, my first investment being in Irys, a urban-centric technology platform
                from San Antonio. </p>

            and business background.  On the left is me during my Trek to Everest
            Base Camp.  After that is my father who has been my mentor my whole life.
